# DEVELOPMENT

AdpartSim rely on the [Chakra](https://github.com/mlcommons/chakra) component for execution graph input (custom execution graph input components can also be defined), depend on [glog](https://github.com/google/glog) for log management, depend on [nlohmann_json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) to parse json file, and rely on [NS3](https://www.nsnam.org/) for network simulation. Since the Chakra is currently used as the execution graph input, the module for computing simulation has not yet been implemented, but development interfaces have been reserved, and development can be carried out based on future needs. AdpartSim uses C++ as the main development language, requiring the compiler to support the C++20 standard, and the version of the CMake tool should not be lower than 3.22.
